# Electra-Tweets-Classifier

## Overview

This is a NLP Kaggle Challenge I attend in May 2021, by using the state of the art language model, it is able to achieve 1.0 (full) Kaggle score, and ranked top 5% in the competition.

This is a classification problem, the objective is to identify emergency tweet at high accuracy. Kaggle is providing about 4500 tweets each label as 1 meaning emergency, or 0 meaning non-emergency. The challenge is to correctly predict whether a unseen example is emergency tweet or not.
